# Nahual Courses

This is a little e-learning site meant to be users for courses in Nahual Project, an ONG.

## Local setup

There's already a course about that on this site.
You can check it on production version of this site (coming soon).
Or just look at the [source code of the course](https://github.com/nicooga/nahual_courses/blob/master/courses/how_to_contribute/lessons/02-local-setup/lesson.md).
